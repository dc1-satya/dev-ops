Firewalls play an important role to control Network Traffic.

The Linux kernel includes the Netfilter subsystem which is used to control network incoming and outgoing traffic.

Linux firewalls utilize Netfilter. The administrator tells Netfilter how to treat data packets by configuring rules in iptables, a configuration file.

In Ubuntu, we use ufw as a configuration tool for iptables.
